### Server 1 ###

TODO 1: Explain that you can give a scheduling context while making the thread,
        but you can also bind it after. For this tutorial we bind after, the next
        one binds on configure.

TODO 2: Might have to reiterate that TCB != SC

TODO 3: Pretty straightforward, make sure they set budget = period to keep it
        simple for now, and pick a reasonable number (100 seems to work fine).

TODO 4: After they've done this one, explain that they have an active server,
        same as the seL4 tutorial. They can try run it in QEMU.
        Note that there will be an error at runtime since the first reply
        in the server, ignore this for now

Rest should be straightforward.

If you have time, once interesting thing to show is with the ReplyRecv in the
server. After the whole thing is working, split up the reply and recv into
two invocations (seL4_Reply and seL4_Recv) and explain that it doesn't work,
since the server reliquishes its SC before it can wait on the endpoint.

### Server 2 ###

The code being written is mostly a repeat of the previous one, but everything is
active here. The most important part is to change the budget / period parameters
and see the different results. Some examples are provided at the top of the file
(TODO 4).
